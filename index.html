        <h2>Introduction:</h3>
            <p> Hello, I’m Jonathan Darwin, currently serving as a Senior Customer Support Executive at XYZ Corp. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in problem-solving, communication, and understanding customer needs, which has fueled my passion for technology and innovation.
                With a growing interest in software development, I am actively upskilling through various coding courses and hands-on projects to bridge the gap between customer support and software engineering. My goal is to transition into the software development sector, where I can leverage my analytical skills and technical knowledge to contribute to creating impactful solutions. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my experience in a new context and am committed to continually learning and growing in this dynamic field.
