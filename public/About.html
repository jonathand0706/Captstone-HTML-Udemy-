<pre style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans', Arial, sans-serif;"><p>Hi there,

    Virtual classmates.
    
    I know that y'all may wonder why I've used CSS in this HTML capstone project. It' just that I had happened to learn a little bit of HTML and CSS long before I had ever imagines that I would be taking up this course on Udemy. Glad to be a part of Angela's classroom. 
    
    yeah, Maybe a class room where tis just me on my own. However, the fact that she teaches topic so damn well keeps me motivated. I'm currently working as a customer support agent locally. I'd like to make a career in the field of Software development. 
    
    I see that Web development could be the initial steps I need to take In-order to get there. I Wish y'all the very best. Hope you feel the same for me. that's about it for now.
    
    Thank you.</p></pre>
